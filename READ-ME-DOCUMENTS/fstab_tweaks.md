# fstab tweak
Option to add mount point tweaks to either enhance ssd performance or save wear and tear.
* data=ordered
  - Ensures data ordering, improving file system reliability and performance by writing data to disk in a specific order.
* defaults
   - Applies the default options for mounting, which usually include common settings for permissions, ownership, and read/write access.
* discard
   -  Enables the TRIM command, which allows the file system to notify the storage device of unused blocks, improving performance and longevity of solid-state drives (SSDs).
* errors=remount-ro
  - Remounts the file system as read-only (ro) in case of errors to prevent further potential data corruption.
* noatime
  - Disables updating access times for files, improving file system performance by reducing write operations.
* nodiratime
  - Disables updating directory access time, improving file system performance by reducing unnecessary writes.
* relatime
  - Updates the access time of files relative to the modification time, minimizing the performance impact compared to atime

This command will attempt to mount all filesystems specified in /etc/fstab that are not currently mounted. If there are any errors, they will be displayed.

Please note that some changes to the /etc/fstab file may still require a reboot to take effect, especially if they involve system-critical filesystems. 
If you've made changes related to the root filesystem or other essential components, a reboot is recommended for those changes to be fully applied.
